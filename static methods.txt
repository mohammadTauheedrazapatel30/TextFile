Static Methods

-> Created by using static keyword in front of the methods name.

-> Created for memory management as it takes less memory while allocation.

   public static void print(){
          System.out.println("//Something to be print//");
    }
-> A static method only accepts static variables.
-> if we paas non-static variables in static method it will give an error.
-> static method cannot be overriden because of early  binding (In this a variable is assigned to a specific type of object during its declaration to create an early-bound object)(conversion of identifiers i.e. public, private, static, final,void,int,float into addresses)
